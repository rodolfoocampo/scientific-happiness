# Scientific Happiness

This is an open repository to collectively build a principles guide to lead the best life possible based on scientific, peer-reviewed studies. With this, we aim to build a guide with solid scientific foundations that anyone can use to make the choices that define their life. More so, we aim to do this is a decentralized fashion where people from multiple backgrounds can contribute.
